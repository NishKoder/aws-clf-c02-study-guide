### AWS Lambda

> **Definition**: AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that runs code in response to events without provisioning or managing servers.

#### ⚡ Serverless Computing Concepts

**Key Principles:**
- **No Server Management**: AWS handles infrastructure automatically
- **Event-Driven Execution**: Functions respond to triggers
- **Automatic Scaling**: Handles 1 to thousands of concurrent executions
- **Pay-per-Use**: Only pay for compute time consumed

#### 🔄 Event-Driven Architecture

```python
# Example: S3 file processing Lambda function
import json
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    """
    Triggered when a file is uploaded to S3
    Processes the file and updates a database
    """
    s3_client = boto3.client('s3')
    
    # Get bucket and object key from event
    bucket = event['Records'][0]['s3']['bucket']['name']
    key = event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['key']
    
    # Process the file
    try:
        # Your file processing logic here
        print(f"Processing file: {key} from bucket: {bucket}")
        
        return {
            'statusCode': 200,
            'body': json.dumps('File processed successfully')
        }
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error processing file: {str(e)}")
        raise
```

#### 📊 Common Triggers

| Trigger Source | Use Case | Example |
|----------------|----------|---------|
| **API Gateway** | Web APIs | REST API endpoints |
| **S3** | File processing | Image resizing, data validation |
| **DynamoDB** | Data changes | Audit logs, notifications |
| **CloudWatch** | Scheduled tasks | Daily reports, cleanup jobs |
| **SQS/SNS** | Message processing | Order processing, notifications |

D) AWS Fargate  

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**✅ Correct Answer: C) Amazon EC2**

**Explanation**: Amazon EC2 is the correct choice because it provides full virtual machines with complete administrative control over the operating system. Legacy applications often require specific OS configurations, custom software installations, registry modifications, and persistent storage—all of which are only available with EC2. Lambda is serverless and doesn't provide OS access, ECS is for containerized applications, and Fargate is a serverless container platform that doesn't offer the required OS-level control.

### Question 2
**A startup wants to build a web application backend that processes user uploads, resizes images, and stores them in S3. The processing happens infrequently and unpredictably. Which pricing model would be most cost-effective?**

A) EC2 On-Demand instances running 24/7  
B) EC2 Reserved Instances with 3-year commitment  
C) AWS Lambda with pay-per-invocation pricing  
D) EC2 Spot Instances with auto-scaling  

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**✅ Correct Answer: C) AWS Lambda with pay-per-invocation pricing**

**Explanation**: Lambda is ideal for this scenario because the workload is event-driven (triggered by file uploads), infrequent, and unpredictable. With Lambda, you only pay for actual compute time used during image processing, not for idle server time. The processing task (image resizing) is well-suited for Lambda's execution model and time limits. Running EC2 instances 24/7 for occasional processing would waste money on unused capacity, and Reserved Instances require predictable usage patterns to be cost-effective.

### Question 3
**What is the primary benefit of using an Application Load Balancer (ALB) with an Auto Scaling Group?**

A) It reduces the cost of EC2 instances  
B) It provides SSL encryption for data in transit  
C) It distributes traffic across healthy instances and automatically adjusts capacity  
D) It backs up EC2 instances automatically  

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**✅ Correct Answer: C) It distributes traffic across healthy instances and automatically adjusts capacity**

**Explanation**: The primary benefit of combining ALB with Auto Scaling Groups is high availability and scalability. The ALB performs health checks and only routes traffic to healthy instances, while the Auto Scaling Group automatically launches new instances when demand increases and terminates them when demand decreases. This combination ensures your application can handle varying traffic loads without manual intervention while maintaining availability even if individual instances fail. While ALB can handle SSL termination (option B), this isn't its primary benefit when used with Auto Scaling Groups.

### Question 4
**Which statement about AWS Lambda is FALSE?**

A) Lambda functions can run for a maximum of 15 minutes  
B) You pay only for the compute time your code consumes  
C) Lambda automatically scales to handle thousands of concurrent requests  
D) Lambda functions maintain persistent local storage between invocations  

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**✅ Correct Answer: D) Lambda functions maintain persistent local storage between invocations**

**Explanation**: This statement is false. Lambda functions are stateless and do not maintain persistent local storage between invocations. Each function execution starts with a clean environment, and any files written to the local file system are lost when the function completes. For persistent storage, Lambda functions must use external services like S3, DynamoDB, or EFS. All other statements are true: Lambda has a maximum execution time of 15 minutes, uses pay-per-use pricing, and automatically scales to handle concurrent requests.

### Question 5
**A company needs to run a containerized microservice that requires consistent performance and must be available 24/7. They want to minimize operational overhead. Which combination of services should they choose?**

A) Amazon ECS with EC2 launch type  
B) Amazon EKS with self-managed node groups  
C) Amazon ECS with Fargate launch type  
D) EC2 instances with Docker installed manually  

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**✅ Correct Answer: C) Amazon ECS with Fargate launch type**

**Explanation**: ECS with Fargate is the best choice for minimizing operational overhead while ensuring consistent performance. Fargate is a serverless container platform that eliminates the need to manage underlying EC2 instances—AWS handles patching, scaling, and infrastructure management automatically. ECS provides the orchestration needed for a 24/7 microservice with built-in health checks and service management. Option A (ECS with EC2) requires managing the underlying instances, option B (EKS) adds Kubernetes complexity, and option D (manual Docker) provides no orchestration or automated management capabilities.

</details>

---

### Question 6
**When would you choose EC2 Spot Instances over On-Demand instances?**

A) For critical production workloads that cannot tolerate interruption  
B) For batch processing jobs that can handle interruptions gracefully  
C) When you need guaranteed compute capacity for a specific time period  
D) For applications requiring consistent, predictable performance  

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**✅ Correct Answer: B) For batch processing jobs that can handle interruptions gracefully**

**Explanation**: Spot Instances are ideal for fault-tolerant, flexible workloads that can handle interruptions. Batch processing jobs typically fit this category because they can save their progress and resume later if interrupted. Spot Instances offer up to 90% savings compared to On-Demand pricing but can be terminated with just 2 minutes' notice when AWS needs the capacity back. They should not be used for critical production workloads (option A), applications requiring guaranteed capacity (option C), or those needing consistent performance (option D), as these requirements conflict with the interruptible nature of Spot Instances.
