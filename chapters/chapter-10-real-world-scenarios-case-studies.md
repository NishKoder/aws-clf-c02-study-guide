## üìù Reflective Quiz

**Question 1:** A healthcare organization needs to store patient X-ray images with strict access controls and audit requirements. Which combination of AWS services would be most appropriate?

A) S3 + IAM + CloudWatch  
B) S3 + IAM + CloudTrail + KMS  
C) EC2 + EBS + IAM  
D) RDS + IAM + CloudWatch  

**Correct Answer:** B) S3 + IAM + CloudTrail + KMS

**Explanation:** Healthcare data requires comprehensive security and compliance measures. S3 provides scalable storage for large image files, IAM enables granular access control, CloudTrail creates audit trails for compliance (essential for HIPAA), and KMS provides encryption key management for data protection. CloudWatch alone doesn't provide the audit trail functionality required for healthcare compliance.

---

**Question 2:** An e-commerce company experiences traffic spikes during flash sales that are 10x their normal load. Their current infrastructure crashes during these events. What AWS approach would best address this challenge?

A) Increase EC2 instance sizes permanently  
B) Use Auto Scaling Groups with CloudWatch alarms  
C) Deploy more RDS read replicas  
D) Implement only CloudFront caching  

**Correct Answer:** B) Use Auto Scaling Groups with CloudWatch alarms

**Explanation:** Auto Scaling Groups automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on demand, using CloudWatch metrics to trigger scaling actions. This provides cost-effective scaling that handles traffic spikes without over-provisioning during normal periods. Simply increasing instance sizes (A) is expensive and doesn't address sudden traffic spikes. Read replicas (C) help with database performance but don't address web server capacity. CloudFront (D) helps but doesn't solve the underlying capacity issue.

---

**Question 3:** A university wants to build a serverless Learning Management System that can scale from 1,000 to 100,000 users without managing servers. Which service combination is most suitable?

A) EC2 + RDS + S3  
B) Lambda + API Gateway + DynamoDB  
C) ECS + Aurora + ElastiCache  
D) Elastic Beanstalk + RDS + CloudFront  

**Correct Answer:** B) Lambda + API Gateway + DynamoDB

**Explanation:** This combination provides true serverless architecture. Lambda functions automatically scale based on demand without server management, API Gateway handles request routing and can scale to handle massive traffic, and DynamoDB provides serverless NoSQL database capabilities. Options A, C, and D all require server management and capacity planning, which contradicts the serverless requirement.

---

**Question 4:** A media company needs to deliver video content globally with consistent performance. Their current solution has slow loading times in Asia and South America. What AWS services would best improve their global performance?

A) Multiple EC2 instances in different regions  
B) S3 + CloudFront + Global Accelerator  
C) ELB + Auto Scaling + RDS  
D) Lambda + API Gateway + S3  

**Correct Answer:** B) S3 + CloudFront + Global Accelerator

**Explanation:** This combination optimizes global content delivery. S3 stores the origin content, CloudFront provides edge caching at locations worldwide for faster access, and Global Accelerator uses AWS's global network infrastructure to optimize routing for users in regions with poor internet connectivity. The other options don't specifically address global content delivery optimization.

---

**Question 5:** A financial services company requires real-time fraud detection, comprehensive audit trails, and encryption for all data. Which AWS services combination addresses these requirements?

A) RDS + S3 + IAM  
B) DynamoDB + Lambda + CloudWatch  
C) RDS + KMS + CloudTrail + CloudWatch  
D) S3 + ECS + Auto Scaling  

**Correct Answer:** C) RDS + KMS + CloudTrail + CloudWatch

**Explanation:** This combination meets all requirements: RDS provides reliable transactional data storage, KMS handles encryption key management for data protection, CloudTrail creates comprehensive audit trails for regulatory compliance, and CloudWatch enables real-time monitoring for fraud detection. The other combinations miss critical components like encryption management or audit trails.

---

**Question 6:** When comparing serverless vs. traditional server-based architectures for an educational application with unpredictable usage patterns, what is the primary advantage of serverless?

A) Better performance under all conditions  
B) Lower costs and automatic scaling without capacity planning  
C) More control over underlying infrastructure  
D) Easier debugging and monitoring  

**Correct Answer:** B) Lower costs and automatic scaling without capacity planning

**Explanation:** Serverless architectures excel with unpredictable workloads because they automatically scale to zero when not in use and scale up instantly when needed, resulting in cost optimization and eliminating the need for capacity planning. Traditional architectures require maintaining server capacity even during low-usage periods. Performance (A) depends on specific use cases, control (C) is actually reduced in serverless, and debugging (D) can be more complex in serverless environments.
