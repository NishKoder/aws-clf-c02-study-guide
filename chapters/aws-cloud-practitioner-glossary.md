## Overview

This glossary contains 30 essential AWS terms that frequently appear on the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification exam (CLF-C02). Each term includes clear, beginner-friendly definitions covering the core service areas:

- **Compute Services** (EC2, Lambda, Auto Scaling)
- **Storage Services** (S3, EBS)
- **Identity & Access Management** (IAM, MFA, Security Groups)
- **Billing & Cost Management** (Pay-as-You-Go, Reserved Instances, Free Tier)
- **Networking** (VPC, CloudFront, Route 53)
- **Support & Monitoring** (CloudWatch, Trusted Advisor)

## How to Use This Glossary

1. **Study Method**: Read through terms alphabetically or by service category
2. **Practice**: Try to define each term before reading the provided definition
3. **Application**: Think of real-world use cases for each service
4. **Review**: Regularly revisit terms you find challenging

> üí° **Tip**: Focus on understanding the **purpose** and **benefits** of each service, not just memorizing definitions.

## üìö Glossary of Key AWS Terms

### A

**Auto Scaling** - A service that automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances in your application based on demand. This helps maintain performance during traffic spikes while reducing costs during low-demand periods.

**Availability Zone (AZ)** - An isolated data center within an AWS Region that provides redundant power, networking, and connectivity. Each Region contains multiple Availability Zones to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

**AWS CloudFormation** - A service that allows you to define your cloud infrastructure using templates written in JSON or YAML. This enables you to create and manage AWS resources in a predictable and repeatable way.

**AWS CloudTrail** - A service that records API calls and user activity across your AWS account for auditing and compliance purposes. It provides a detailed log of who did what, when, and from where in your AWS environment.

**AWS CloudWatch** - A monitoring service that collects and tracks metrics, logs, and events from AWS resources and applications. It helps you gain insights into your system's performance and set up automated responses to changes.

**AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** - A service that controls who can access your AWS resources and what actions they can perform. It manages users, groups, roles, and permissions to secure your AWS environment.

**AWS Lambda** - A serverless computing service that runs your code in response to events without requiring you to manage servers. You only pay for the compute time your code actually uses.

**AWS Organizations** - A service that helps you centrally manage multiple AWS accounts, apply policies across accounts, and consolidate billing. It's useful for businesses with complex organizational structures.

**AWS Support Plans** - Different levels of technical support offered by AWS, ranging from Basic (free) to Enterprise. Higher tiers provide faster response times, dedicated support staff, and additional resources.

### B

**Billing Dashboard** - The central location in the AWS Management Console where you can view your current and past bills, track spending, and manage payment methods. It provides detailed breakdowns of costs by service and resource.

### C

**CloudFront** - AWS's content delivery network (CDN) that delivers your content to users from edge locations closest to them. This reduces latency and improves the user experience for websites and applications.

### E

**Elastic Block Store (EBS)** - A high-performance block storage service designed for use with EC2 instances. It provides persistent storage that remains available even when an EC2 instance is stopped or terminated.

**Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)** - AWS's virtual server service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. You can launch virtual machines with various operating systems and configurations based on your needs.

**Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** - A service that automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances or other resources. It improves application availability and fault tolerance by routing traffic away from unhealthy instances.

### F

**Free Tier** - AWS's introductory offering that provides limited access to many services at no cost for 12 months after account creation. It's designed to help new users explore and learn AWS services without incurring charges.

### I

**Internet Gateway** - A horizontally scaled, redundant component that allows communication between your VPC and the internet. It enables resources in your public subnets to connect to the internet and receive inbound connections.

### M

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** - An additional security layer that requires users to provide two or more verification factors to access AWS resources. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised.

### P

**Pay-as-You-Go** - AWS's fundamental pricing model where you only pay for the resources you actually use, with no upfront commitments. This allows for flexible scaling and cost optimization based on actual demand.

### R

**Region** - A geographical area where AWS has multiple data centers (Availability Zones) that are isolated from other Regions. Each Region operates independently to provide data residency and compliance with local regulations.

**Reserved Instances** - A pricing option that allows you to reserve EC2 capacity for 1 or 3 years in exchange for significant discounts compared to On-Demand pricing. This is ideal for predictable, steady-state workloads.

**Route 53** - AWS's scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service that translates domain names into IP addresses. It also provides domain registration and health checking capabilities for your applications.

### S

**S3 (Simple Storage Service)** - AWS's object storage service that provides secure, durable, and scalable storage for any amount of data. It's commonly used for backup, archiving, websites, and data analytics.

**Security Group** - A virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic for EC2 instances and other AWS resources. It acts as the first line of defense by allowing or denying traffic based on rules you define.

**Shared Responsibility Model** - AWS's security framework that defines which security tasks AWS handles (security "of" the cloud) versus what customers are responsible for (security "in" the cloud). Understanding this model is crucial for proper security implementation.

**Simple Notification Service (SNS)** - A messaging service that sends notifications to subscribers via email, SMS, or other endpoints. It's commonly used to alert administrators about system events or send notifications to application users.

**Simple Queue Service (SQS)** - A message queuing service that enables decoupling of application components by allowing them to communicate asynchronously. Messages are stored in queues until they're processed by receiving components.

**Spot Instances** - EC2 instances that use spare AWS capacity at up to 90% discount compared to On-Demand prices. They can be interrupted by AWS with short notice, making them suitable for flexible, fault-tolerant workloads.

### T

**Trusted Advisor** - An automated service that analyzes your AWS environment and provides recommendations for cost optimization, security, performance, and fault tolerance. The level of recommendations depends on your AWS Support plan.

### V

**Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** - A logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch resources in a virtual network that you define. It provides complete control over your network environment, including IP address ranges, subnets, and routing tables.

### W

**Well-Architected Framework** - AWS's set of best practices and design principles for building secure, reliable, efficient, and cost-effective systems in the cloud. It consists of five pillars: operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization.

## üìù Study Tips

### For the AWS Cloud Practitioner Exam:

1. **Understand Service Categories**: Group services by their primary function (compute, storage, networking, etc.)
2. **Focus on Use Cases**: Know when to use each service rather than technical implementation details
3. **Learn Pricing Models**: Understand different pricing options like On-Demand, Reserved, and Spot pricing
4. **Security Concepts**: Master the Shared Responsibility Model and basic IAM concepts
5. **Global Infrastructure**: Understand Regions, Availability Zones, and Edge Locations

### Memory Techniques:

- **Acronyms**: Create memorable acronyms for service groups
- **Real-world Analogies**: Compare AWS services to familiar concepts
- **Practice Tests**: Use official AWS practice exams to identify knowledge gaps
- **Hands-on Experience**: Try services in the AWS Free Tier when possible
