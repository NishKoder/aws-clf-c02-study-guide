## ✅ Answer Key with Explanations

### Questions 1-10: Foundation Concepts

**✅ Q1. Correct Answer: C**
> **Explanation:** AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time consumed. EC2 requires server management; RDS is a managed database service; EBS provides block storage for EC2 instances.

**✅ Q2. Correct Answers: A, B, D, E**
> **Explanation:** Key AWS Cloud benefits include trading capital expense for variable expense, benefiting from massive economies of scale, stopping capacity guessing, and increasing speed and agility. AWS doesn't eliminate security considerations - customers still have security responsibilities under the shared responsibility model.

**✅ Q3. Correct Answer: C**
> **Explanation:** Amazon S3 is designed for 99.999999999% (11 9's) durability, meaning if you store 10 million objects, you can expect to lose a single object once every 10,000 years. EBS provides block storage, EFS provides file storage, and FSx provides fully managed file systems.

**✅ Q4. Correct Answer: C**
> **Explanation:** The AWS shared responsibility model divides security responsibilities: AWS secures the cloud infrastructure (security OF the cloud), while customers secure their data and applications (security IN the cloud). This includes customer data, platform, applications, identity and access management, and network traffic protection.

**✅ Q5. Correct Answer: B**
> **Explanation:** AWS Direct Connect provides a dedicated network connection between your premises and AWS, offering more consistent network performance than internet-based connections. VPN uses the internet, Route 53 is DNS, and PrivateLink provides private connectivity between VPCs and services.

**✅ Q6. Correct Answers: A, B, D, E**
> **Explanation:** Amazon S3 Standard offers low latency, high throughput, 11 9's durability, and is suitable for frequently accessed data with 99.99% availability. It's not the most cost-effective for long-term archival (that would be Glacier classes).

**✅ Q7. Correct Answer: B**
> **Explanation:** AWS CloudTrail logs API calls and account activity, providing audit trails for security analysis and compliance. Config tracks resource configurations, CloudWatch monitors performance metrics, and Trusted Advisor provides optimization recommendations.

**✅ Q8. Correct Answer: B**
> **Explanation:** The maximum size for a single object in Amazon S3 is 5 TB. For objects larger than 100 MB, AWS recommends using multipart upload for better performance and reliability.

**✅ Q9. Correct Answers: A, B, D, E**
> **Explanation:** Compute services include EC2 (virtual servers), Lambda (serverless functions), ECS (container orchestration), and Batch (batch computing). RDS is a database service, not a compute service.

> **Explanation:** EC2 purchasing options include On-Demand (pay per hour/second), Reserved (1-3 year commitments), Spot (bid for unused capacity), and Dedicated Hosts (physical servers). Scheduled Instances were deprecated in 2021.

**✅ Q17. Correct Answer: B**
> **Explanation:** Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) provides fully managed message queuing. SNS is for notifications, Kinesis is for streaming data, and Step Functions coordinate workflows.

**✅ Q18. Correct Answer: B**
> **Explanation:** AWS IAM manages user access and permissions to AWS services and resources. It controls who can access what resources and what actions they can perform.

**✅ Q19. Correct Answer: C**
> **Explanation:** Amazon Redshift is AWS's data warehousing service optimized for analytics and business intelligence workloads. RDS is for operational databases, DynamoDB is NoSQL, and ElastiCache is for caching.
