```bash
# Create Auto Scaling policies based on CloudWatch metrics
aws autoscaling put-scaling-policy \
    --auto-scaling-group-name web-tier-asg \
    --policy-name scale-out-policy \
    --policy-type TargetTrackingScaling \
    --target-tracking-configuration '{
        "TargetValue": 70.0,
        "PredefinedMetricSpecification": {
            "PredefinedMetricType": "ASGAverageCPUUtilization"
        },
        "ScaleOutCooldown": 300,
        "ScaleInCooldown": 300
    }'
```

```python
# Lambda function for automated remediation
import boto3
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    """
    Automated remediation for common CloudWatch alarms
    """
    
    # Parse CloudWatch alarm from SNS
    message = json.loads(event['Records'][0]['Sns']['Message'])
    alarm_name = message['AlarmName']
    new_state = message['NewStateValue']
    
    if alarm_name == "WebTier-HighCPU" and new_state == "ALARM":
        # Trigger additional Auto Scaling action
        autoscaling = boto3.client('autoscaling')
        autoscaling.set_desired_capacity(
            AutoScalingGroupName='web-tier-asg',
            DesiredCapacity=5,  # Scale out faster during high load
            HonorCooldown=False
        )
        
    elif alarm_name == "Database-HighConnections" and new_state == "ALARM":
        # Restart connection pooling service
        ssm = boto3.client('ssm')
        ssm.send_command(
            InstanceIds=['i-1234567890abcdef0'],  # App server instance
            DocumentName='AWS-RunShellScript',
            Parameters={
                'commands': ['sudo systemctl restart connection-pool']
            }
        )
    
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps(f'Handled alarm: {alarm_name}')
    }
```
